"""
Inventory team's integration test (pytest).

This is the DOWNSTREAM "edge" test. From inventory's perspective the only
question that matters is: did the message I expected actually arrive?

The test attempts to place an order via order-service, then polls
inventory's /processed/:id until it returns 200 or the deadline passes.

Crucially, it does NOT abort the test just because order-service returned
an error — whether that service was reachable is upstream noise outside
the inventory team's scope. The only assertion that fails the test is
"the message never arrived in my consumer." That's the SYMPTOM. Finding
the CAUSE is the orchestrator's job (it walks upstream).

    ORDER_URL=http://localhost:3002 \
    INVENTORY_URL=http://localhost:3003 \
